# EHF TV Kodi plugin

A very basic plugin bringing the content from [EHF TV](https://ehftv.com) into your own Kodi media center. As you will see this is still in a very early stag but I will do my best to improve that.

As this is my first time working on a plugin, it is mostly a rewrite of this [example plugin](https://github.com/romanvm/plugin.video.example). Plugin is only tested in Kodi Leia (18.8). It may or may not work in earlier/later versions. Try at your own risk!

Plugin will require a free EHF TV account.
